# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code of Conduct

Participation in this project comes under the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)

## Finding Issues to Work On

If you're new to the project and want to help, but don't know where to start, look for issues labeled with:

- **[good first issue](https://github.com/agones-dev/agones/labels/good%20first%20issue)** - These are great for
  people who are new to the project. They are typically smaller in scope and easier to tackle.
- **[help wanted](https://github.com/agones-dev/agones/labels/help%20wanted)** - These issues are ready for
  contributions and often include good first issues, but may also involve more complex work for those who want to dig a
  little deeper.

These labels help you find issues that are well-suited for external contributions and where maintainers are actively
looking for help.

For information on how project decisions are made, including voting and governance, see the [Agones Governance](./GOVERNANCE.md) documentation.

# AI Usage Policy

The Agones project has strict rules for AI usage.

Using AI tools to help write your PR is acceptable, **but as the author, you are responsible for understanding every
change**.

If you used AI tools in preparing your PR, you must disclose this in the description of your PR. For example, including
“This PR was written in part with the assistance of generative AI,” in the PR description is sufficient.

Listing AI tooling as a co-author, co-signing commits using an AI tool, or using the assisted-by, co-developed or
similar commit trailer is not allowed.

All contributions must follow the contribution policies and guidelines outlined in this document.

Large AI generated PRs and AI generated commit messages are not allowed.

**Do not leave the first review of AI generated changes to the reviewers**. Verify the changes (code review, testing, etc.)
before submitting your PR. Reviewers may ask questions about your AI-assisted code, and **if you cannot explain why a
change was made, the PR will be closed**.

**When responding to review comments, you must do so without relying on AI tools**. Reviewers want to engage directly with
you, not with generated responses. If you do not engage directly with reviewers, the PR will be closed.

If the approvers conclude that an author's engagement across issues, comments, and/or pull requests is primarily
low-quality LLM-generated content with no meaningful review or adjustment on the author's part, the author may be
temporarily or permanently banned from the agones-dev organisation. In particularly egregious cases, this may happen
without prior warning.

## Submitting code via Pull Requests

*Thank you* for considering submitting code to Agones!

- We follow the [GitHub Pull Request Model](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for
  all contributions.
- For large bodies of work, we recommend creating an issue and labelling it
  "[kind/design](https://github.com/googleprivate/agones/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Fdesign)"
  outlining the feature that you wish to build, and describing how it will be implemented. This gives a chance
  for review to happen early, and ensures no wasted effort occurs.
- For new features, documentation *must* be included. Review the [Documentation Editing and Contribution](https://agones.dev/site/docs/contribute/)
  guide for details.
- It is strongly recommended that new API design follows the [Google AIPs](https://google.aip.dev/) design guidelines.
- All submissions require appropriate automated unit and integration test coverage.
- All submissions, including submissions by project members, will require review before being merged.
- Once review has occurred, please rebase your PR down to a single commit. This will ensure a nice clean Git history.
- If you are unable to access build errors from your PR, make sure that you have joined the [agones-discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/agones-discuss).
- Please follow the code formatting instructions below.

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributions to Agones must be signed off in accordance with the
[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). This is enforced via the
[DCO GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/dco) on all pull requests.

Signing off certifies that you have the right to submit the code you are contributing and that you agree
to the DCO terms. To sign off a commit, use the `-s` or `--signoff` flag with `git commit`:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This appends a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit message using your configured git name and email:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Make sure your git `user.name` and `user.email` are set correctly:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

If you forgot to sign off on previous commits in a pull request, you can amend them:

- For the most recent commit: `git commit --amend --signoff`
- For multiple commits: `git rebase --signoff HEAD~N` (where `N` is the number of commits to sign)

Then force-push your branch to update the pull request.

### Additional Instructions for Unreal Plugin Pull Requests

As there is no CI for the Unreal plugin, the following checklist should be run
manually before the PR is approved, using the latest released version of UE4.

1. Create default C++ template project in UE4.
1. Create a Plugins folder under the project directory (should be a sibling of the .uproject file).
1. Copy the [sdks/unreal/Agones](sdks/unreal/Agones) directory into the Plugins folder.
1. Build the UE4 project.
1. If the build succeeded, paste the build logs into the PR.

## Formatting

When submitting pull requests, make sure to do the following:

- Format all Go code with [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/). Many people
  use [goimports](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports) which
  fixes import statements and formats code in the same style of `gofmt`.
- C++ code should follow the [Google C++ Style
  Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), which can be
  applied automatically using the
  [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) command-line tool
  (e.g., `clang-format -style=Google foo.cc`). The exception to this is
  the [Unreal Engine plugin code](sdks/unreal/Agones), which should follow the
  [Unreal Engine 4 Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Development/CodingStandard/index.html).
- Remove trailing whitespace. Many editors will do this automatically.
- Ensure any new files have [a trailing newline](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5813311/no-newline-at-end-of-file)

## Feature Stages

Often, new features will need to go through experimental stages so that we can gather feedback and adjust as necessary.

You can see this project's [feature stage documentation](https://agones.dev/site/docs/guides/feature-stages/) on the Agones
website.

If you are working on a new feature, you may need to take feature stages into account. This should be discussed on a
 design ticket prior to commencement of work. 

## Continuous Integration

Continuous integration is provided by [Google Cloud Container Builder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/),
through the [cloudbuilder.yaml](./cloudbuild.yaml) file found at the root of the directory.

Build success/failure with relevant details are pushed automatically to pull requests via [agones-bot](./build/agones-bot/README.md).

See the [Container Builder documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs/) for more details on
how to edit and expand the build process.

## Kubernetes Versions Update
### When to update supported Kubernetes Versions
As documented in the [version update policy](https://agones.dev/site/docs/installation/#agones-and-kubernetes-supported-versions), each version of Agones supports 3 releases of Kubernetes. The newest supported version is the latest available version in the GKE Rapid channel and at least one of the 3 supported version is supported by each of the major cloud providers (EKS and AKS). This means whenever a new minor version is available in the [GKE Rapid channel](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes-rapid), we should check whether we can roll forward the supported versions.
### How to update supported Kubernetes Versions
Please follow the steps below to update the Kubernetes versions supported.

1. Create a Issue from the [kubernetes update issue template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/kubernetes_update.md) with the newly supported versions.
2. Complete all items in the issue checklist.
3. Close the issue.

#### Coding and Development

- [How to write a good Git Commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) -
  Great way to make sure your Pull Requests get accepted.
- **Log levels usage:**
  - Fatal - a critical error has happened and the application can not perform subsequent work anymore. Examples: missing configuration information in case there are no default values provided, one of the services can not start normally, etc.
  - Error - a serious issue has happened, users are affected without having a way to work around one, but an application may continue to work. This error usually requires someone’s attention. Examples: a file cannot be opened, cannot respond to HTTP request properly, etc.
  - Warn - something bad has happened, but the application still has the chance to heal itself or the issue can wait for some time to be fixed. Example: a system has failed to connect to an external resource but will try again automatically.
  - Info - should be used to document state changes in the application or some entity within the application. These logs provide the skeleton of what has happened. Examples: system started/stopped, remote API calls, a new user has been created/updated, etc.
  - Debug - diagnostic information goes here and everything that can help to troubleshoot an application. Examples: any values in business logic, detailed information about the data flow.
